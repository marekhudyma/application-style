# Application style 
In this application I demonstrate `oppinionated` style of writing backend application based on Java, Spring. 

## Integration Tests
Here I demonstrate how to use `Testcontainers` library to develop integration tests. 

# How to build the project 
To build the project execute (including running `integration tests` and `functional tests`)
```
mvn clean install
```

# How to run the application on localhost
```
java --enable-preview -jar target/application-style-exec.jar
```
